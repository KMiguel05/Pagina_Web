								<h2>Building a Biorobotic arm<br />
								</h2>
								<p>
								This project was part of a minor course. The main goal was design and programming a robot that help people 
								that suffer DMD. In this case, the action selected was take a picture. The model of the robotic arm was modeled
								and done using SOLIDWORK. In order to manufacture it, lasser cutting and wood were used. The programming part
								of the robot were done using python. The basic idea was used the impulse of the muscle to move the robotic arm.

								<h2>Modelling a Crack propagation model in ABAQUS<br />
								</h2>
								<p> The transportation by trains are most common way of transportation in The Netherlands. However,
									The safety of the trains is directly linked with the maintenance plans. In order to increase the safety
									of the passenger. A new alternative to prevent accident in the rails was proposed by this project.
									The simulations of a crack over a rail was studied under different scenarios. The model was done using eXtended Finite Element method
									in ABAQUS. The results can be found
